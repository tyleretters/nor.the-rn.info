_Northern Information_ emerged from the primordial mists of 2006. The logo first adorned the back of a certain series of metaphysical pamphlets known as _Guns of the Philosopher_.

Seven years later, it mutated into _tyler etters & the northern information movement_ with the release of [the geometrie of our lost cause](https://northerninformation.bandcamp.com/album/the-geometrie-of-our-lost-cause). This marked chapter one of a nine album project called _the trilogy of trilogies_.

2020's [The Arecibo Lamentations](https://northerninformation.bandcamp.com/album/the-arecibo-lamentations) saw the designation return to simply _Northern Information_.

Later that year, as the pandemic raged, the _Applied Sciences & Phantasms Working Division_ was established and the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/northern-information) was instantiated.

2021 brought about an industrious shift to _Northern Information, LLC_ as I explored various capitalistic ventures with the entity. Now, in 2023, I am in the final steps of dissolving the LLC and I couldn't be more relieved.

_Northern Information_ has always been my icebreaker - my vessel with which to cut through the harsh seas of time. It has served as a beacon, a publishing house, a website, a broadcast station, a band, a company...

While its callsign and tactics may have changed over the years, its objective has remained ever constant: the future.
