Just 31 days into the new decade, at 11:00PM GMT, Britain left the European Union. Recorded bells from Big Ben - currently under renovation - pealed in the new era. Only time will tell what comes next, what this all means.

Watching the videos I knew one thing for certain: this is our time's Berlin Wall, only inverted. A celebration of separations, of new legal and geopolitical barriers. We've witnessed this thing unfold for years and I'm happy to see closure. I am incapable of assigning a value judgement to Brexit. Conversely, as an American, I cannot imagine the fall of the Berlin wall being anything other than a "good" thing. I just hope it all works out.
