![Dark Souls 3](/rm_ation/images/dark-souls-3.jpg)

Too many blog posts on hospice. Fiddled with them too much. Lost the plot. I opened each markdown file, in turn... and decided the best course of action was to simply rename the directory `failed blog posts`, place it in my 2022 archive, and move on. Some embers need to be released, though:<!--x-->

**Kiln**

> The final moments of Dark Souls 3 are a metaphor of internet culture at the end of 2022. I stand atop a ruined staircase. It has been a long journey to get here. I am alone. It is dark. There is something that could have been once called a city, but is now unrecognizable. A snarl of ruin and metaverse. In the distance, a more stable structure perhaps? All around me are messages from others who came before. We'll never know anything about one another aside from: we were both here, we left messages, and - perhaps most importantly - we were feeling something strong enough to share it.

**Textbook Panopticon**

> If you work at a small or medium company, Slack is going to be a mid-trust to high-trust environment by definition because everyone knows your true name. Furthermore, all participants are enmeshed in the same web of corporate tools, handbook signatures, and all-hands meetings. Human Resources are the mods but they don't even have to do anything. It is a textbook panopticon. The moderation problems that Meta or Twitter face simply doesn't exist.

**Polycrisis**

> ... seeking resources I can only articulate as "professional crisis empathy?" Last night there was a shooting and one of my teammates lives in close proximity. During morning standup, how the fuck do you say, "Hey, I know a dozen people were slaughtered within a couple miles of your home last night and wow you sure look like you have it all together this morning, and I know asking how're you doing is a total gaffe because I can tell you're upset so do I send a direct message about it or something or is this all just way too neurotic and the is best gift I can give really just a few more minutes of work immersion?" It's this Big Other in most professional settings that you're not allowed to talk about and I think that's a strange way for a culture to operate.

**Mourning**

> Given 7 million deaths, a healthy society would perhaps prioritize collective mourning.

**Matter**

> ... to confirm the oil change and various tune ups were OK before committing to my longest solo trek yet. It was a pleasant test-ride from Santa Clarita to Chinatown. Cooling off, now that it's fall. I typically work from home, as do most of my colleagues. I've been trying to make Wednesday's the "work from work" day because I miss it. I miss packing a lunch. I miss having a reason to shave. I miss having a reason to wear real clothes instead of lounge-wear. None of it has mattered for so long, and I'm not sure it ever will again.

**Cringe**

> Cringe is just authenticity in the wrong context.

**Dream Logics**

> Imagine these two extremes on the x-axis of The Bell Curve of Territories Unclaimed. To explore the region under the bell, some venture off into planes of alternate tunings and micro-tonalities. Others commune with artificial intelligence. Yet others build their own instruments with their own internal dream logics.

**Nude**

> I'm reminded of the time I went to one of those "get a taste of college" events when I was in high school. I was looking at art schools and I went to this summer camp thing at the Art Institute. I was one of two people in the film cohort. Most of the kids were there for video games. Anyways, looking back, it had to be someone's idea of a joke because for one of the activities they ship all of us into a room for figure drawing with a nude model.

**Better**

> It is better than it was, but worse than it will be.
