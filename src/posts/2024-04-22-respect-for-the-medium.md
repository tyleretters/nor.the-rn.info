## Tracklist

1. Respect for the Medium (22:49)

## Notes

<p>The fundamental audio loop is more Gabrieli.</p><p>The DV tape loop is from Fireflies & Fields, a deeply personal series shot straight out of camera. Summer, 2009. Just after sunset. "Night Mode" enabled camera on a tripod facing south-south-east. Fairfield Road a bit to my back and right. A solid two-minute hike across the prairie to touch the first oaks in the shot. Macro lens on. Optical zoom maxed. Digital zoom zero. The key: auto-focus enabled to force the beacons into a duel until dawn. The loop you see employs neither dissolve nor crossfade. It is the same hard cut over and over until the song ends. After originally releasing a zoomed and cropped version at 1920x1080, I have decided to delete and repost at 720x480. Once you see the Taraxacum mote ascending you will never unsee it.</p><p>The artwork is also from Fireflies & Fields, also straight out of camera.</p><p>These sorts of things are important to me.</p><p>Respect for the medium.</p>
