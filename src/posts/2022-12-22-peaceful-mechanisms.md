> Despite being informed by billions, this new technological hegemony isn't democratic; it's a swarm-led form of para-governance programmed to maximize engagement while obfuscating responsibility for the social and<!--x--> environmental damage it wreaks. Zuckerberg, Bezos, Thiel, and other tech behemoths are quick to remind us that they're not in charge of public laws or policy; their empires were built according to the "peaceful mechanisms" of free-market capitalismâ€”and that society has adopted their tools and spaces through its own free will. If pressed, they'll point out how their platforms reflect the countercultural demands of earlier generations: eschewing big government and vertical corporate culture while encouraging personal fulfillment and flat organizational structures. Today you can be a coder and a DJ, an Uber driver and a travel blogger, a Sand Hill Road suit and a Robot Heart Burner.
