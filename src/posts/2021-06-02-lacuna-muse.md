    - any of a number of sister goddesses, originally given as Aoede (song), Melete (meditation), and Mneme (memory), but latterly and more commonly as the nine daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne who presided over various arts: Calliope (epic poetry), Clio (history), Erato (lyric poetry), Euterpe (music), Melpomene (tragedy), Polyhymnia (religious music), Terpsichore (dance), Thalia (comedy), and Urania (astronomy); identified by the Romans with the Camenae.

When I was just starting out as an artist, my muse was typically a person (read: love interest) or a place (read: desolate midwest vistas sewn together with powerlines). This held more or less true until work begain on the [Trilogy of Trilogies](/2017/12/23/the-trilogy-of-trilogies/). My muse became - vainly - myself. I think. How much can I learn? How much could I push myself? How can I say the thing I've been trying to say?

With this shift I began thinking about myself as the primary audience for my work. And not just my present self, but specifically my future self.

Another shift happened in 2019. I was deep into [theory](/2019/05/24/coordinated-universal-time/), reading about hyperobjects, thinking about the anthropocene. [As my work output shows](/discography) this was not a particularly productive time. EP1 came out at the beginning of 2019, Arcologies at the end of 2020. In retrospect I see I swung too far into theory and lost touch with praxis.

2020 brought about another shift. Urgency, a sense of hopelessness, a sense of possiblity, very real fears about death and mortality for myself and my loved ones.

It is with this latest arc that my recent creative endeavors are informed: [STUXNET](https://stuxnet.me), [virtual community building](https://llllllll.co/t/45273), and now (again) film.

Today we begin shooting.
