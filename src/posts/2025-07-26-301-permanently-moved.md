[Jay Springett](https://thejaymo.net/2025/07/26/2520-episode-301/):

> 8 years, 15 seasons; 301 episodes; over 25 hours of audio and roughly 290,000 words of script.
>
> Begun at age 32, completed today, the day after I turned 40: one fifth of a lifetime distilled into a body of work.
>
> Creative ambitions I harboured in my twenties, and realised in my thirties, are now both distant and fulfilled.
>
> When I began, the idea of committing to 301 episodes would have been laughable – the point was simply to begin.
>
> But by Episode 240 I hit a wall. During 2023 the enjoyment was gone and making the show felt painful. But while walking along the Thames that summer, the idea of 301 episodes arrived in a flash and a finishing line rose over the horizon. At that moment the complete project snapped into focus; and the pleasure of creation returned.
>
> I am not sad the format is ending. Instead I feel proud, accomplished, complete. I’m excited for what’s next.
