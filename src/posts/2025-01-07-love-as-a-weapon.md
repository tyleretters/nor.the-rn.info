As an artist, part of my job is to think about my audience. Who are they? Where do they come from? How are the like or unlike me? The interesting thing - for me specifically - is that my primary audience has always been precisely (unfortuntaely) the same person: myself.

_"All you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be." - Roger Waters_

I am a time artist. Music is my favorite expression of this class-alignment. Music requires time to operate in ways that other media do not. Imagine being able to read 1,000 words per minute. (As of writing this there are probably AIs that are optimized to do much better.)

At 1,000 words per minute you could read the entirety of Blood Meridian in about two hours.

But there's no way to increase your "listenings per minute."

I happen to be part of the caste that can wield, what I think I am arguing, is the most powerful time-traveling and multi-dimensional tool known to man. This is not hyperbole. This is `git`.

So I leave myself treats like `date: 02012-12-12` to force my future self into writing little functions like `longNowToUtc()` for the rest of my life.

It's play.
