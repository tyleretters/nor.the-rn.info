 Nature doesn't make long speeches.
 A whirlwind doesn't last all morning.
 A cloudburst doesn't last all day.
 Who makes the wind and rain?
 Heaven and earth do.
 If heaven and earth don't go on and on,
 certainly people don't need to.

 The people who work with Tao
 are Tao people,
 they belong to the Way.
 People who work with power
 belong to power.
 People who work with loss
 belong to what's lost.

 Give yourself to the Way
 and you'll be at home on the Way.
 Give yourself to power
 and you'll be at home in power.
 Give yourself to loss
 and when you're lost you'll be at home.

 To give no trust
 is to get no trust.
```

&mdash; Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching #23 (Ursula K. Le Guin translation)
