2. Fractal's Edge (11:02)

## Notes

<p>At the behest of an anonymous agent, the Northern Information Applied Sciences & Phantasms Working Division agreed to the impossible: rationalize the numogram for the post-pandemic age.</p><p>It is accepted that the numogram first manifested in the 90s via research from the CCRU. However, newly unearthed forensic evidence from The tf.nist.gov Timeserver Incident has cast a shadow of doubt on the true provenance.</p><p>After the NIAS&PWD design scientist rationalized the numogram into a mathematically pure vector format, new sonic pathways were unlocked for STUXNET. The dossier was delivered and lead to yet more revelations: the existence of what can only be described as a time firewall. And, perhaps more unsettling, "fractal edges" thereby calling into question the very foundations of topology, Euclidean space, and recursion dynamics.</p><p>Intertext formally published a request for support in understanding the implications of these twin entities on April 18, 2021.</p><p>Operator instructions: `mv numogram.txt numogram.ai`</p>
