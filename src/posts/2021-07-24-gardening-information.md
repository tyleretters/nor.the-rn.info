> Information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty; it answers the question of "What an entity is" and thus defines both its essence and the nature of its characteristics. The concept of information has different meanings in different contexts. Thus the concept becomes synonymous to notions of constraint, communication, control, data, form, education, knowledge, meaning, understanding, mental stimuli, pattern, perception, proposition, representation, and entropy. &mdash; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information)

I came here to write about some things that were on my mind but I ended up spending an hour or three "gardening" the site. Tidying up files, learning about CSS `counter`s, filling out latest entries in my discography, refactoring the books page... I call this gardening instead of "development" because the process is more of a dialog than the execution of a plan. I listen to the site, to what it needs, to where the weeds whisper. When gardening, you have no clue when mushrooms will pop up or a small critter will decide to move in. I experience this same sense of mystery and wonder and suprise when working with code.
