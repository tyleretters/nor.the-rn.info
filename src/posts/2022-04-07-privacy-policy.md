This website is now open source. I had it set to "private" for the longest time because I used to keep a `_drafts` directory with lunatic scrawlings and half-baked thoughts. I'm happy to report these have since been published or expunged.

A privacy policy now lives in the footer. Today, it reads:<!--x-->
