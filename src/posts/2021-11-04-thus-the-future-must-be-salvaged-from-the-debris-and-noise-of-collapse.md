From [Soundtrack To The End of History Part Two](https://thehaunt.substack.com/p/soundtrack-to-the-end-of-history-28f):

> Really it's a track that forces the listener to confront the fact that the new world is something fought over, the present is a wreck, and thus the future must be salvaged from the debris and noise of collapse. Hope is not a feeling or emotion but is an active practice in the world, but even so small moments of hope can be drowned. It ends with what sounds like a train crash - history can be run off the rails and the survivors chased down and hunted.
