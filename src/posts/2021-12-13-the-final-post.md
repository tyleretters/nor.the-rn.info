Whenever a social media user dies, there is exactly one final post in their short-term memory.

Who is the author of the final post?

Perhaps it is the departed - they read their own craft before sputtering up into Ã¦ther.

Perhaps it is an AI - they-being, content-tracing, proclivities-inferring, libidinal-apotheosis.

Perhaps it is their mother - ghosts of the boomers, looming in the alcove, another round.

Perhaps it is a reporter - breaking-news from former frontlines of event horizon.

Perhaps it is you - and ... what was your last post?

Again?
