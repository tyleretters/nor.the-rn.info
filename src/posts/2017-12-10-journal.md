After 5 years the SoundCloud journal project is complete.

The journal began in the fall of 2012 as a means to release emotional and psychic energy in controlled bursts. Since then, it has grown to become something of a timeline, a geological sedimentary marker for phases of inquiry. Many songs birthed here ended up in the trilogies.

With the imminent conclusion of [The Trilogy of Trilogies](/2017/12/23/the-trilogy-of-trilogies), it seemed prudent to close the endeavor. If you would like to hear these again do get in touch and a download link will be provided.
