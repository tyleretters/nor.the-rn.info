> But perhaps the most relevant historical parallel to today's "vibe coding" debate happened in 1973. Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson decided to rewrite Unix in a new language called C. The idea of writing an entire operating system in a high-level language was considered absurd.

> Critics argued:
>
> 1. It would be too slow
> 2. You'd lose control over the hardware
> 3. The added complexity would make the system unmaintainable
>
> Instead, C's abstraction of machine details enabled Unix to become one of the most portable and influential operating systems ever created. As Thompson later noted: "Unix is very simple, it just needs a genius to understand its simplicity."
