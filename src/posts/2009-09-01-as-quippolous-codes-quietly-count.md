## Notes

<p>As Quippolous Codes Quietly Count is a journey through prismatic mists of somnolence and destiny, gates of shimmering keyboard harmonics, mold-emblazoned percussives, and delerious, sludge-filled wastelands where only the foolish and the brave trek. Recorded over the course of 2 years, the album could easily be mistaken for an impressionistic account of a journey through space amidst a fleet of ghost ships.</p>
