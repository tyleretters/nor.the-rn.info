## Notes

<p>Dear listener,</p><p>During the turn of the century in Chicago there was a radio station called WNRG Energy 92.7/5 . I was 12 or so and would always fall asleep listening to the likes of DJ Sammy, DJ Encore, PPK, D-Devils, Armin van Buuren, Sylver, ATC, and countless others. I pictured the radio waves blanketing Chicagoland's orange phosphorous haze from Kenosha to Kankakee; euphoric FM signals in an adjacent dimension. Compressed audio. The crackle of static. It was spiritual.</p><p>How many others were listening along with me?</p><p>How many others allowed themselves to be moved to tears in the music's rapture?</p><p>One night all the DJs were there. They kept talking and laughing and telling stories. Being a trance radio station, this was quite irregular. They were sad. Then I realized: this was the final broadcast.</p><p>LONG LIVE THE LOST ONES is a very special album for me, as the track titles may (or may not) reveal.</p><p>The melodies were mostly written while flying back and forth between Los Angeles and Chicago during that brief season Sage and I were commuter spouses. Winter 2019/2020. At the end of the old world and the threshold of the new.</p><p>With LONG LIVE THE LOST ONES, we find my nightly streams, my deep tryst for unabashedly earnest trance, and my endless experiments with lo-fi and distortion finally in conjunction. A constellation of energy, euphoria, and catharsis.</p><p>I've started having visions of people dancing together again. These visions haunt and inspire me. Perhaps one day sooner than we think, DJs will return to the decks and revelers will return to the floors.</p><p>None of us were ready for 2020. It is only now becoming clear what cultural trauma the pandemic has wrought. Scorched earths, decimated families, and shattered cultures. There is so much mourning to do.</p><p>Everything is going to be different from here out.</p><p>Once again, we must learn to dance.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Tyler</p>
