![My first patch](/images/my-first-patch.jpg)

I've made the plunge into modular.<!--x--> This is my first patch: [Doepfer A-110-1 Standard VCO](http://www.doepfer.de/home_e.htm) into [Intellijel Outs](https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/outs/). The result? A sine wave and bottomless joy.

## TIL

Today I learned there are (at least?) two types of screws for eurorack. The world I am in uses M3 screws. What world needs M2.5?
