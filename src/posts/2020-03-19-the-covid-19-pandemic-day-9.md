![Self Isolation](/images/self-isolation.jpg)

Sage and I have been self isolating all week. I left the house for the first time yesterday to make copies of keys and mail them to my mom. She is going to rescue my plants. I do not expect to return to Chicago for months.

Leaving the house yesterday was harrowing. My journey took me to no less than three locksmiths, one hardware store, the post office, and a coffee shop to get beans.

I saw two other people with face masks.

San Francisco is ordered to shelter-in-place and here, in Santa Clarita, in the same state, people are continuing on like nothing is wrong.

I got home, washed all my clothing, took a shower, and started playing Skyrim.
