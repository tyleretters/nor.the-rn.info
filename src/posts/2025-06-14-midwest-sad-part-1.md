## Tracklist

1. midwest sad, part 1 (59:18)

## Notes

<p>If "you had to be there" then I wouldn't have made this mixtape. It was a very specific time and place. But the music we played was just "music" to me. It would be years later until I learned that it was all actually emo, midwest-emo, screamo, hardcore, metalcore, progressive... It was folk music for us, right? So we start in the midwest. Appleseed Cast (Kansas) then over to Dr. Manhattan (Illinois), The Felix Culpa (also Illinois), and then a bit less underground when we climb the Seer's Tower with Mr. Stevens. It goes on from there. This is a time capsule. This is midwest sad, part 1. Man your own jackhammer.</p>
