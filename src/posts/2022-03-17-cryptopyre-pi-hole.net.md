[Tonight's CRYPTOPYRE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKYY5N9yw4o) was fun. We formatted a Raspberry Pi and installed [pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net). As usual, the small audience and myself enjoyed plenty of pleasant digressions into various tangents like [today's deepfake](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/16/facebook-zelensky-deepfake/) and Apple's [Private Relay](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212614).
