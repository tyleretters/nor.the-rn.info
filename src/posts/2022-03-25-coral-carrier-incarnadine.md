A small team and I have been working on a game for several months. It is called Coral Carrier Incarnadine. You can follow development here: [https://cci.dev](https://cci.dev)

> Lead the CC Incarnadine and her crew of climate-punks, nautical drones, and GMO algae on a mission to heal the desiccated coral reefs.

I expect development to take several years.

Perhaps decades.

In fact, by the time development of this game is complete, most of earth's coral reefs could be dead.
