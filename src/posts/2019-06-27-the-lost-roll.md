I can't believe it has been six years since I shot film. I used to go out just about every week. I forgot how much I enjoyed it. Each roll became something of a time capsule and, like my tattoos, helped me move through time.

Years ago, I used to work in the photo department at Sam's Club so I had easy access to developing and processing my own film. Not to mention I was going to Columbia College Chicago and had access to a fantastic dark room.

I have a confession to make: after leaving that job and graduating, I would just get my film developed at Walgreens. Eeep.

And now that I think about it, I simply stopped shooting when Walgreens got rid of their onsite C41 machines. Honestly, the thought of mailing my film terrified me, so I just stopped altogether.

Anyhow, I've been aware of this undeveloped roll in for years and the thought of it became too much to bear. I found [thedarkroom.com](https://thedarkroom.com), faced my fears (if it is lost in the mail, it is no different than staying in my fridge forever), and sent it in.

The scans just came back and I feel like I've unlocked a time capsule. This roll contains my usual adventures in Chicago, plus travels to San Francisco and Tennessee. This is back when [Sage](https://sageetters.com) had her head shaved! Here are some highlights.

I also found dozen unshot rolls...
