## Notes

<p>Serial Index of Unclaimed Memories File 1 is a spiraling nine track safari into the chaotic and serene realms of post-electronica. Astral, delay-riddled guitars, trip-hop/IDM drums, orchestrated ambience, lo-fi cassette deck samples, distorted bass, and psychosis inducing drones are just a few of the cards brought to the table.</p>

## Credits

<p>Composed, produced, and engineered by Paul Petrosyan and Tyler Etters.</p>
