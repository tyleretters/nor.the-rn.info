> Earth teach me stillness<br>
> as the grasses are stilled with light.
>
> Earth teach me suffering<br>
> as old stones suffer with memory.
>
> Earth teach me humility<br>
> as blossoms are humble with beginning.
>
> Earth teach me caring<br>
> as the mother who secures her young.
>
> Earth teach me courage<br>
> as the tree which stands all alone.
>
> Earth teach me limitation<br>
> as the ant which crawls on the ground.
>
> Earth teach me freedom<br>
> as the eagle which soars in the sky.
>
> Earth teach me resignation<br>
> as the leaves which die in the fall.
>
> Earth teach me regeneration<br>
> as the seed which rises in the spring.
>
> Earth teach me to forget myself<br>
> as melted snow forgets its life.
>
> Earth teach me to remember kindness<br>
> as dry fields weep with rain.
