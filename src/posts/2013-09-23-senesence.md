From the digital liner notes: "there was a time before these experiences shaped us. do you remember? years before we scaled all those unforgiving mountain ranges, before the codes were counted, and before the firmament fell. melting. wavering. corporeal. now our minds are increasingly augmented by technology and time's passage becomes difficult for our hearts to feel. do you remember! before your phone vibrated in your pocket every fifteen minutes to remind you of minutia that is neither here nor there? do you remember! before we lived in fear of the police ticketing us for being at the park after sunset? do you remember!!! here i am again. alone late at night and drowning in drones. i have finished the last songs, bounced them to cassette to engineer some lo-fi glory, and i now present them to you, dear listener, in the utmost humility - for i walked away from too many projects and i have turned down too many friends to fold now."
