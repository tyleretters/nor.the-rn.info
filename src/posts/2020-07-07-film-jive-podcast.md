I was invited to participate in the latest episode of Film Jive. It was a great experience and I'm really moved to have been asked to be a part of it.

Here it is on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-99-tutorials-in-self-isolation/id479559706?i=1000483130629), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2kt01EmSyCuYilkHP7looi?si=Vvyc8SBgQ42fE8gIxBIDPw), and [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmZlZWRidXJuZXIuY29tL0ZpbG1KaXZl/episode/aHR0cHM6Ly9maWxtLWppdmUuY2FzdG9zLmNvbS9wb2RjYXN0cy84MjM3L2VwaXNvZGVzL2VwaXNvZGUtOTktdHV0b3JpYWxzLWluLXNlbGYtaXNvbGF0aW9u?ved=0CAIQkfYCahcKEwjA8s3_zbvqAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQBQ).

> As a result of the enduring Covid-19 pandemic, the ticking of the clock no longer seems actual in any remote sense. We have collectively entered recursive time loops, fractals and spirals where the measurements of time; seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, etc. are little more than an afterthought. An intersection of present and future has been crossed where memories are no longer composed of fragmented pasts, but of viral futures.
>
> This episode is a psychogeographic sonic collage composed of field recordings, original music, poetic recitations, fireside readings and found audio materials which were imagined and composed during this ever-evolving temporality of quarantine by a variety of artists and thinkers. It is a podcast composed in and for the present, wherever it can be found.
