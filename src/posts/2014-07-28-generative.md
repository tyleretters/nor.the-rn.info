Sometimes you just have to give up. The intention of releasing a unique 'generative' track with each of the hundred cassette purchases has been cast into the wind. Twenty-five hours of generative music is good. Infinity hours of generative music is better. Download the [live master file](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/northerninformation/generative.zip) and play the first scene. The #shadow_fi Trilogy is over. The #shadow_fi Trilogy is endless.
