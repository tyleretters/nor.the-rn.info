## Notes

<p>Serial Index of Unclaimed Memories File 2, is comprised of nine seperate tracks (here called 'Movements'), and is akin to a stream of consciousness dialouge between failing super-computer systems. Almost enitrely ambient, File 2 explores an entirely different realm than File 1.</p>

## Credits

<p>Composed, produced, and engineered by Paul Petrosyan and Tyler Etters.</p>
