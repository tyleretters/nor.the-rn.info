Last year I wrote about [my trauma surrounding of 9/11](/2019/03/03/fear-immainence/) and [how I arrived at some level of closure](/2019/09/11/personal-mythologies-ii-9-11). In the posts, I pondered when "the next one" was going to hit. It has hit. It is COVID-19.

My project of the 2020s is to emotionally and intellectually process the pandemic as it unfolds. I'm older now. I have a better frame of reference for the world. Maybe this time around I can help others process, too.
