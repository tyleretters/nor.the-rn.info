[Erik Davis](https://www.burningshore.com/p/ai-eeeeeee), doing the vital work of metabolizing the ongoing weirdness of artificial intelligence:

> Grappling with weirdness may help us learn to work with disturbing and even terrifying transformations that overwhelm our ability to model or comprehend. Weirdness gives us a vibe to tango with, an imaginal tradition to plug into, even an ethics of wayward otherness to orient us, so that we can work on what reality matters amidst the purple haze of the reality-tunnel information war already dawned. Weird can be icky-sticky, but getting to know its depths provides a strange power and steadiness, not unlike the ability to be OK in the presence of corpses, or gods, or pathologies of all stripes. Nothing human is alien to me, and nothing alien either.
