I just completed the soundtrack for [Synergy Beat: Future World Digest](https://synergybeat.club/), a cyberpunk anime zine from the mind of Gage Lindsten. The project assembles many talented artists and we did the whole thing in just a couple weeks. For each track, I assumed the role of a (silly) fictitious band:

- **The Future World Neural Net:** an AI in the likeness of Wintermute that scrapes the web for audio samples and pieces together music.
- **キル ナイト:** an urban pre-teen obsessed with energy drinks and throwback videogame music.
- **Lavender Stranger:** anonymous and blurry profile picture of some victorian wallpaper.
- **Bio Mint:** an eclectic global collective who share compose via torrents on shuttered P2P networks.
- **The Infinity Tigers:** SoundCloud indie-pop superstars make their first electronic track.
- **Shock Model Duo:** brother DJs from some eastern European bloc.
