[![dispatches from the prime meridian](/images/dispatches-from-the-prime-meridian.jpg)](https://northerninformation.bandcamp.com/album/dispatches-from-the-prime-meridian)

Released on the winter solstice, when both darkness and light hang in a wary balance.

From the digital liner notes: "winter - city - neon dusk - service economies - capitalist realism - the hinge upon which the world turns - unexpected password reset - borrowed anxiety medication - ritual scarification of the mind - ego death - a thousand faces - monomyth - megalith - emergency motorcycle repair - sargasso sea - aggregate browser histories - anonymous cookies - london bridge is falling down - traffic rerouted through eastern europe - all roads lead to rome - the empire never ended - golgothan solstice - eclipse - ellipsism - algorithm - the flash crash of 2010 - the jackpot - universal coordinated time - quick response code - boarding pass - light pollution - the people's republic of the great pacific garbage patch - skeleton music - voodoo technology - hypothetical histories - satellites - orbital sovereignty - metalaws - the singularity already happened - death is the only way out of the information age - metadata reincarnation - the second unix epoch - as above so below - as below so beyond - at dusk there is no wind"
