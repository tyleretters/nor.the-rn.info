Marc has been a source of inspiration for me since the pandemic started. I discovered his [Disquiet Junto](https://disquiet.com/2016/07/14/junto-0237/) project during the first dim months of lockdown.<!--x-->

He has consistently shared news, raw materials, links, and prompts _each week for the last ten years._ If you're looking for consistent inspiration and perhaps even a community of thoughtful electronicists with whom to palaver:

> Marc Weidenbaum founded the website [Disquiet.com](https://disquiet.com) in 1996 at the intersection of sound, art, and technology, and since 2012 has moderated the Disquiet Junto, an active online community of weekly music/sonic projects. He has written for Nature, Boing Boing, The Wire, Pitchfork, and NewMusicBox, among other periodicals. He is the author of the 33 1/3 book on Aphex Twin's classic album Selected Ambient Works Volume II.
