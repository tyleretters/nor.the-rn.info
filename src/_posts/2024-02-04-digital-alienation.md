[Byung-Chul Han, on how we might respond to a world of digital alienation:](https://artreview.com/byung-chul-han-i-practise-philosophy-as-art/)

> [...] I refer to objects as resting places for life because they stabilise human life.<!--x--> The same chair and the same table, in their sameness, lend the fickle human life some stability and continuity. We can linger with objects. With information, however, we cannot.

> If we want to understand what kind of society we live in, we have to comprehend what information is. Information has very little currency. It lacks temporal stability, since it lives off the excitement of surprise. Due to its temporal instability, it fragments perception. It throws us into a continuous frenzy of topicality. Hence it's impossible to linger on information. That's how it differs from objects. Information puts the cognitive system itself into a state of anxiety. We encounter information with the suspicion that it could just as easily be something else. It is accompanied by basic distrust. It strengthens the contingency experience.
