I've fired up a #tumblefeeds channel on the [Northern Information Discord](https://discord.gg/FHDdUJugzU) server. This channel is a melange of new media artists, collectives, organizations, writers, musicians, friends, and foesâ€¦

I believe the way forward is actually a return to the blogosphere if the 00's. Microblogging is dead. Get out there, buy an artsy domain, and make a personal blog. This is a step towards digital sovereignty.

If you'd like to be syndicated on the #tumblefeeds, send me a message.
