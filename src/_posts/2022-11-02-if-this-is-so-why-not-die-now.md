Would it not be the most graceful act to flow this logic ≋F≋U≋R≋T≋H≋E≋R≋? For all of us to choose the nearest spot of ground & collectively, in one painless instant, take the simplest path to our universal destination? Finding, finally, the sublime universal connection that escaped us in life in a simultaneous last breath?
