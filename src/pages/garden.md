![Connectedness Locus Emergency Akashic Records](/images/akashic.gif)

> A man sets out to draw the world. As the years go by, he peoples a space with images of provinces, kingdoms, mountains, bays, ships, islands, fishes, rooms, instruments, stars, horses, and individuals. A short time before he dies, he discovers that the patient labyrinth of lines traces the lineaments of his own face.

â€• Jorge Luis Borges, The Aleph and Other Stories
