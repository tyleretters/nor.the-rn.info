> The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space.

― Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities

> as an artist you have two jobs: to not give up. and to help others not give up.

> we imagined an artist collective whose statement of existence is “no, we are literally responsible for preventing the collapse of the universe”. which, like, is intense, we’ll admit, and we want to reserve space for playfulness.

> we dream. when we meet new people we ask what is their dream, their passion. to us, one inferno of the world is that many people don't know what their dream is. maybe dreams are getting too complicated, maybe the technology to enable them failing us, maybe dreams are being taken away, or stomped out of us, or put out of reach. but we can still have them and we want to find out what they are for others and we want to help others discover them + nurture them.

> there’s a sense of inspiring from a darkness, to find the others.

> we think people in general could have a much better time being silly and also informed.

> Whenever I feel this way, I find it helpful to remember that the entire universe will eventually come to a cold dark halt due to the heat death of the universe theory. In the face of such a fate, the very best we can do is to have an amazing time being creative and kind while we are still here. Not to accomplish anything but just because we are creative by nature... And because nothing worthwhile is achieved by being unkind...
