My name is Tyler Etters. I'm a midwesterner holed-up in the mountains by 𝐿𝑜𝑠 𝐴𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠 with [my wife](https://etters.co) and two cats. In 2025 I'm:

- engineering for [Discogs](https://discogs.com)
- causing mayhem at [Circular Ruin DSP](https://circularruindsp.com)
- mixing as [DJ Stuxnet](https://stuxnet.me)
- releasing music as [They Became What They Beheld](https://tbwtb.com)
- producing tunes for [RGB](https://untitled.stream/library/project/RoTfZpW8dHvJVVpmd6kpf)
- appreciating my framed BFA from [Columbia College Chicago](https://colum.edu)
