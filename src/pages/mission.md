My mission is to inspire others with music.

I believe artists have two jobs:

1. To not give up.
2. To help others not give up.

And more broadly:

```txt
Brim-fill the bowl,
it'll spill over.
Keep sharpening the blade,
you'll soon blunt it.

Nobody can protect
a house full of gold and jade.

Wealth, status, pride,
are their own ruin.
To do good, work well, and lie low
is the way of the blessing.
```
